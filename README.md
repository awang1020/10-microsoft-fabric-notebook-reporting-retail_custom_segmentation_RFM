# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis — Microsoft Fabric & Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **customer segmentation analysis** using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model, built on **Microsoft Fabric** with data modeling in **PySpark** and **Power BI** for visual storytelling.

It aims to help marketing teams **identify customer behavior patterns** and develop **targeted strategies** to increase engagement, retention, and revenue.

## 🧮 RFM Model Explained

- **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase
- **Frequency (F)**: How often they purchase
- **Monetary (M)**: How much money they spend

Each customer is scored on a scale (e.g. 1–5), and segments are created based on combined scores (`RFM_Score`) and clustering (`KMeans`).

## 📈 Segments Identified

| Segment Name             | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **At Risk**              | Haven’t purchased in a long time, low spend |
| **Big Spenders**         | High value, few recent purchases             |
| **Frequent Low Spenders**| Buy often, lower spend per purchase          |
| **Recent Customers**     | New clients with good potential              |

## 🗂️ Data Sources

- Retail transaction dataset uploaded to Fabric Lakehouse (`retail_sales_dataset.csv`)
- Columns:
  - `date`, `customer_id`, `totalamount`, `transactionid`, `age`, `gender`, `productcategory`, etc.

## 🛠️ Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Standardization of column names
- Generation of `customer_id` if missing
- Aggregation by customer: Recency, Frequency, Monetary

### 2. RFM Scoring
- Quartile-based scoring for R, F, and M
- Combined score (`RFM_Score`)
- Custom logic for business segments

### 3. Clustering (KMeans)
- RFM scores standardized and passed into `KMeans` (k=4)
- Segments renamed for business readability

### 4. Joining Enriched Data
- Joining RFM output with customer info (age, gender, nb_transactions)
- Stored as a consolidated table: `customer_segmentation`

### 5. Power BI Report
- Scorecards: Total clients, Total Revenue, Distinct Segments, Avg Spend
- Donut chart: Clients by Segment
- Bar charts:
  - Spend by Segment and Gender
  - Spend by Segment and Age Group
- Table: Segment-level averages (monetary, frequency, recency)
